So remember when I said I was going to feature freeze JGDLib, well I lied. After watching the Unite keynote, I decided I needed to celebrate the incoming PBS pipeline with a collection of entirely unrealistic, definitely not physically based shaders.

These now require a little bit of documentation, then it will be feature freeze and commence scrounging for some testers.
