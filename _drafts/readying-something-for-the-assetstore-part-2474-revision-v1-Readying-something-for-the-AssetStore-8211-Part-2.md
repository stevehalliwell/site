So I think I&#8217;ve decided to charge something for what I am now calling JDGLib, Just Games Dammit being the business game I registered.  I came to this conclusion for a number of reasons;

  * It&#8217;ll be great to see any money come from this effort
  * I&#8217;ll feel obligated to respond to support emails/requests so at least if it costs money I&#8217;ll feel like that support is already paid for
  * Paid asset will almost certainly lower the number of users, which makes me less anxious

Also good doco will have to be my savior here. So <a class="vt-p" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NxtNWmVFIoCGXhcz9wGi2mc4kSX0irOm38cM2Rlhzu4/edit#" target="_blank">this</a> is what I&#8217;ve completed so far. I&#8217;ll also need to do up rational, class explanations and usage for Object Pools, Easing and Camera Shake. I&#8217;ll link to these in the asset store listing so I&#8217;m envisioning that the clear use cases and usage methods will stop people from buying it thinking its something it isn&#8217;t.
