I&#8217;ve tided up the folder containing all the work I did for one of the earlier assessments for my CSU Games subject, the goal was to choose a AAA game and identify and analyse its basic elements; Dramatic, systematic and gameplay.

This was done primarily by following the prescribed text &#8216;[_Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach_](http://www.amazon.com/Game-Design-Workshop-Playcentric-Innovative/dp/0240809742){.vt-p}&#8216; and also some other basic ideas; concept docs, _Caillois_&#8216;s [modes of play](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=mQfIAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y){.vt-p}, extended version of _Bartle&#8217;s_ player types, _Koster&#8217;s [Theory of fun](http://www.theoryoffun.com/){.vt-p} _and an attempt at using _[Dan Cook&#8217;s Skill Atoms](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/129948/the_chemistry_of_game_design.php?page=3){.vt-p}._ I was fairly pleased with the result._
