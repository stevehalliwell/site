I posed my new Scripting for Game Development students with creating a core prototype of Flappy Bird. Doesn&#8217;t take too long to get the core running and its well under 100 lines of code.

For me, the trick at this point to getting it to feel even remotely good is totally bullshit physics values. Right now the bird is .5m, gravity is -16m/s/s, mass is 1kg with a drag of .4 and a impulse strength of ~10n.

**Update:Â **With the addition of about 15 more lines we now have personal bests to beat.
