Quick job of putting together a 3 dim of freedom spring with linear limits. I tried using the built in springs but they were a little crazy. At the moment it still relies on the rb to maintain velocity and dampening, I&#8217;m not sure I like that so I&#8217;ll probably move that out so it simulates itself in isolation of whatever the physics engine may want to do.
