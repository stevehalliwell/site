This week we&#8217;ll talk about monitoring student progress, play testing and questionnaires, blogs and brief 2.

# Monitoring

As I think we&#8217;ve already discussed almost everything that is required by LOs we request that students document what they&#8217;ve learned, how their process has changed or what they&#8217;d do next time. That is done via blogs, both dev diary, post-mortem and self analysis.

# Questionnaires

We got all the students to make a draft questionnaire the first lesson and refine it after discussing them in class. It&#8217;s very limited in the number of questions, this time only 2 questions. The key points we went over are;

  * We video capture the play session so don&#8217;t ask questions of the player that you can get from watching the video afterwards.
  * Don&#8217;t ask yes/no or other 1 word questions. 
      * We don&#8217;t have the numbers for these to become statistically relevant.
      * Always image the potential answers you will get and then figure out how you can use that to improve your design.
  * Ask questions that will force players to articulate answers based on their understanding of your game.
  * Ask questions in the areas that are core to the game, especially at this early stage. 
      * While it may be an interesting question with interesting answers, interrogating the aesthetics of your main menu as it relates to the central emotional experience of your second to second loop probably isn&#8217;t the thing you need feedback about right now.

We&#8217;ll talk about these more when they come around again.

# Playtesting

The game for brief 1 had a mandatory 2min game session length so we got everyone in the class to play everyone else&#8217;s game and answer their questionnaire, we then had enough time to gather some staff (games, support, student services) to come through and play a few of them too. This means they get a range of feedback from players that know everything about their game to people who&#8217;ve not only never heard of it or the brief but also don&#8217;t play games that regularly if at all.

[people want to chat, that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s for]

# Blogs

We gave them a bunch to do;

  * Just finished a game, do a post-mortem. This is part of an LO.
  * You probably made a bunch of stuff, how did you make it, how did that change from previously. This is evidence for LOs.
  * Just did a project that required a lot of separate skills, so do up a self skill assessment, in the future which areas do you need to focus on improving and which areas are you strong in, so you can help others. This is part of a few different LOs.

# Brief 2

Starts next week, we will be assigning them into groups of 3-4. They will be playtesting this next prototype in week 6 and again in week 8. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HUAB-6vK-NeNWcG_xaduk1ExW5HylRt3Z_xuc3VpHLE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">This brief can be viewed here.</a> Again the purpose of this unit is to build design skills, so this is intentionally constructed to force them to avoid merely emulating the things they already understand.

&nbsp;

So it&#8217;s the end of week 2 and each and everyone of the students as delivered a game prototype and undergone a mini-version of the process we will repeat throughout the trimester, with different people and with more complex briefs. It was a lot of stuff, it was hard and it&#8217;s not going to slow down.

Next week groups, pitching and <a href="http://thestudios.gallery" target="_blank">thestudios.gallery</a>
