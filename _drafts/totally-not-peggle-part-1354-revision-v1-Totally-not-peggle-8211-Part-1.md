Something I threw together after work today. Made with Unity using 4.3&#8217;s new 2d sprites and NGUI. Box2d (which is what the new 2d physics system in unity is) is SOOO much better at this kind of interaction than physX was.

Think I&#8217;ll add more to it later tonight and tomorrow after work.

UPDATE: Didn&#8217;t end up doing anymore last night. Ok so <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53300249/not%20peggle%20part%202/Build.html" target="_blank">HERE</a>Â is the same thing but with a auto generated grid level. Now to juice it.
