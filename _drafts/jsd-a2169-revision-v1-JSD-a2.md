A friend managed to clear the &#8216;last&#8217; level of the enemy waves so I felt obliged to push some of the minor work I&#8217;ve done since a1 went up.

A2:  
added versioning to upgrade data and splash  
changed missile launch pattern  
player grace period after hit  
clamp inside screen  
vibrate on dmg

On the horizon;  
All new progression based on spreadsheets not gut instinct  
more upgradable stuff  
More waves  
better spawning  
More Textures  
More feedback
