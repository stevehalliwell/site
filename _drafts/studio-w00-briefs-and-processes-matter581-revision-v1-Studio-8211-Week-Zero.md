  In this blog series we&#8217;ll be discussing the studio units I run at SAE, including; interpretations, planning and executing, tips and tricks and anything else that comes up.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The plan is for a blog to go up each week. At times it may seem a bit cagey, this being public and available to students I don’t want to spoil any of their surprises.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Let’s dive in. At this point we have the big milestones locked in, we know when projects start and end, when they require testing and when they will have design interventions, etc.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The Basic structure of any non trivial project we do is;
</p>

<li class="p1">
  Brief <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      Creative limitations and timelines
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Primer <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      Class discussion planned around the key topics we expect them to tackle with the brief
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Groups <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      If it&#8217;s group work we assign them into groups in accordance with our policy
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Brainstorm <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      Fairly unstructured beyond, there should be two phases <ul>
        <li class="p1">
          Expansion, get all ideas out of your head and onto the page. Doesn&#8217;t matter if they seem good or not or too big or whatever, we want it all. Mind maps recommended
        </li>
        <li class="p1">
          Contraction, which things mesh together which don&#8217;t which, which make sense, which are out of scope but what&#8217;s cool about them?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Concepting
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Pitch <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      Feedback
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Refine
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Plan <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      HCD, GDD, TDD, Task Breakdown and schedule, Questionnaire, etc.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Design Intervention <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      Why have you done things the way you have, are they the best ways, the only ways?
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Create
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Playtest <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      Questionnaires answered
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Pivot <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      What is working, what isn&#8217;t, what is the project actually about now that it&#8217;s met the public, what can we cut?
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Update Plan
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Create
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Present <ul>
    <li class="p1">
      Noting changes, probably with more playtesting to confirm their effects.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li class="p1">
  Wrap
</li>
<li class="p1">
  Post-mortem
</li>

Briefs are a tricky beast, they define the limits of what a project can become but not what it actually is. The team will determine what exactly the thing is. The creative limitations also start as the beginnings of the mind map. They need enough &#8216;air&#8217; in them so that teams don’t all end up creating exactly the same thing but not so much that the team spends time searching for the &#8216;right&#8217; concept. We want this so that the teams have individual ownership of the thing and can share the learning experiences that are all slightly different and with different areas of specific interest. It also allows for cross-pollination that doesn’t end up with all the projects homogenising. They also have milestones that we set, this allows us to control scope and focusing the learning. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1toaFkbK7p1UqWeYYNlUoEdeRW1J9pA4KdMBkDQ4kOcI" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s an example of the first brief.</a>

<p class="p1">
  -Orientation<br /> &#8211;learning responsibility<br /> &#8211;projects<br /> &#8211;baselines<br /> &#8211;kpis<br /> &#8211;holisitic
</p>

<p class="p1">
  So the overall structure of Studio 1 is well understood by us at this point, has enough flexibility for us to move things around to suit the cohort and fit in structured content if needed. Project 1 is solo and only 1 week long, it’s a good framing device for acclimatising students to what studio workload is like, the content of the unit itself and gives them a chance to make a decent chunk of progress on a wide variety of LOs (Learning Outcomes). This also assists us with determining groups for the upcoming group projects, so we can take into account students strengths, preferences, existing relationships and areas of interest.

  Project 2 will focus on dynamics will be in groups, last for 4-5 weeks with play testing in the middle. Project 3 the same but focus on aesthetics.

<p class="p1">
  Next week we&#8217;ll talk about pitches, feedback mechanisms and probably more.
