Completed this after work, apart from a short break here and there ( for dinner and such). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg" target="_blank">Lots of basic juice as been added</a>. Music is from <a href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/" target="_blank">Incompetech</a>. Sound effects created in <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/" target="_blank">Bfxr</a>. Easing is done using a little Easing utility I wrote a while back. I&#8217;m pretty happy with it for what is all up only about a day worth of work.

The big things I haven&#8217;t gotten to yet are; cracks in the pegs, proper menu and world map, camera shake and touch friendly input. Perhaps tomorrow.
