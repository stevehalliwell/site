I&#8217;ve thrown together a quick little google doc of how I use source control and unity together. This isn&#8217;t complex but I found in a quick google that a simple guide was hard to locate.

It deals much more with how I use unity in a repo it is not meant to be a guide of how you MUST use it just a way that works for me. It is not really a discussion or explanation of how source control works there are plenty of other places to understand that.
