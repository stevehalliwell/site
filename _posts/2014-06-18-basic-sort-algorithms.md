I have an exam coming up for my Grad Cert. It covers a bunch of data structures and algorithms as well as Java.

I don&#8217;t know about you but what I remember about the internal works of search algorithms is minimal, because they don&#8217;t tend to affect my day to day life, I know which ones I might want to use for certain purposes but generally its .Sort or sort(it, end) etc. As the languages and platforms I use tend to have well tested and pretty optimal solutions built in, these normally being QuickSort or IntroSort.

So in order to better commit these to memory I implemented a bunch of them, not in Java of course (:D), in c++. You can check it out if you like in [my bitbucket profile page](https://bitbucket.org/steve_halliwell){.vt-p}.

Wikipedia obviously.[  
Hungarian sorting dances](https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics/videos){.vt-p} because they are still one of the best visualisations of the algs out there.  
http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/ is a new one that is also quite good as it gives very high level overviews of the algs and is interesting to watch the algs race.
