So I decided that since I often want the same collection of features in all my Unity projects/protos I should bundle all of that together into a lib and make it available on the asset store. These things being Splines, Easing, Pools, Live csv data and a few others are all things that I&#8217;ve written partially because I wanted to or because things on the assetstore didn&#8217;t quite have the features I wanted.  Bits and pieces of it I&#8217;ve already given to students on several occasions and the process is quite odd.

On one hand I think these are very useful and in some cases more feature rich than their competitors on the AssetStore right now, so I could charge money for this lib. At the same time, they make sense to me, not necessarily to everyone in the world and especially not to the non-programming users of Unity, of which there are many. I don&#8217;t feel I have the time to answer lots of support requests. So do I charge lots for it so not many people pick it up on a whim or nothing(or not much) so people don&#8217;t expect a high level of support. To further complicate this I&#8217;d love to be able to just tell the students to go get my lib from the asset store but if its expensive then I cannot really do this, they don&#8217;t have money and its a conflict of interest.

While I&#8217;m on the topic; code libs are easy to demo in the AssetStore package set up. They don&#8217;t have cool screenshots. The best solution I&#8217;ve seen others come up with is to create basic feature tutorials as screen shots or captures of the editor with arrows and text everywhere explaining what you&#8217;ve added and how easy it is to use to do x,y,z now.

I plan to discuss these little systems in detail and my journey of getting them onto the store in future posts.
