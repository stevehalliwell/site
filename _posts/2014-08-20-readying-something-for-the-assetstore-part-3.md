<a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3IiDGqoOqoSZWJfTXoteGRhMG8&usp=sharing" target="_blank">Documentation is complete</a> and I&#8217;m feature freezing JGDLib at this point so I actually push ahead with its release. Without doing this, I fear I&#8217;ll fall into the programmer trap of continually finding new awesome things to add to the library but never release it. No one benefits from that.

So what happens now? Quite a lot actually. I registered my company name and want to put this under than, so its website needs to be up and running (a topic for another blog). I need to do some closed testing with users. This will most likely be work colleges. The focus will be; usability of the software itself, finding both weaknesses documentation and bug hunting. My main concern right now is that I know how to use these because I wrote them, but I need to be so obvious, self-explaining and well documented that I&#8217;m not flooded with support emails from people who have paid for lib post release.

On a side note, the last thing I added to the lib was a projectile solver. It solves the launch angle for a constant speed projectile to hit a moving target. It handles either, both or neither falling under gravity. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53300249/jgdlibdemos/Projectile/Projectile.html" target="_blank">It&#8217;s kinda mesmerizing.</a>
