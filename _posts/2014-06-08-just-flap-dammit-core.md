I posed my new Scripting for Game Development students with creating a core prototype of Flappy Bird. Doesn&#8217;t take too long to get the core running and its well under 100 lines of code.

<a class="vt-p" href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53300249/JustFlapDammit%20V0.1/Build.html" target="_blank">You can try mine here</a>

For me, the trick at this point to getting it to feel even remotely good is totally bullshit physics values. Right now the bird is .5m, gravity is -16m/s/s, mass is 1kg with a drag of .4 and a impulse strength of ~10n.

**Update:Â **With the addition of about 15 more lines we now have personal bests to beat.
