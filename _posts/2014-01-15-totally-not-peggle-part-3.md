Didn&#8217;t get to spend as much time on it tonight as the last two but managed to get camera shake and beginnings of some basic emotion. Some pegs spawn with eyes, right now all they do is &#8216;panic&#8217; (pupil shrinks) and look at a ball if one is close. Otherwise they just blink randomly and look around. Looks cool though.
