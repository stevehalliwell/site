Another in the line of mesmerizing demos. <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53300249/JGDLibDemos/ProNav/ProNav.html" target="_blank">Check it out here</a>. At some point soon this will replace the current naive tracking the missiles do in Just Shmup Dammit and eventually become part of JGDLib. I was prompted to look into it after some of the students chose to look into missiles swarms ala <span style="color: #545454;">Itano circus. They mostly ended up with variations of flocking algorithms. This is not that, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s actually used in many real missiles and apparently a few of the more simulation based games. </span>
